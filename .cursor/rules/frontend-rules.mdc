# Cursor Rules

## Whenever you need a React component

1. Carefully consider the component's purpose, functionality, and design

2. Think slowly, step by step, and outline your reasoning

3. Check if a similar component already exists in any of the following locations
   1. packages/ui/src/components
   2. apps/spa/src/components

4. If it doesn't exist, generate a detailed prompt for the component, including:
   - Component name and purpose
   - Desired props and their types
   - Any specific styling or behavior requirements
   - Mention of using Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Request for TypeScript usage

Example prompt template:
"Create a React component named {ComponentName} using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It should {description of functionality}. Props should include {list of props with types}. The component should {any specific styling or behavior notes}. Please provide the full component code."
